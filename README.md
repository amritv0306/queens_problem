🧩 Queen's Problem (Game on LinkedIn)— Problem & Solutions
This repository contains multiple attempts to solve a visually presented logic puzzle called Queen's Problem (initially found on LinkedIn). The problem involves assigning values or placements under certain constraints, and I’ve documented the journey of solving it through different approaches and languages.

🗂️ Repository Contents
✅ check2.py
Final working solution.
This is the main file containing the cleanest and most efficient implementation of the puzzle-solving logic using recursion and backtracking.

⚙️ check1.py
Initial non-recursive attempt (Python).
Tried solving the puzzle using a non-recursive method. However, the logic became overly complex due to too many conditional checks and variables. Ultimately, this approach was abandoned.

💻 game.cpp
First attempt (C++).
Initially approached the problem in C++, inspired by the classic N-Queens Problem. I assumed this puzzle could be solved by adding a few constraints to that logic. But later, it turned out that a different strategy was needed.
